Dear GitHub

I’m applying for the **Software Engineer, Codespaces** position in **Manchester**.

Let me tell you a story: last year I signed up for the Sponsors Program in the hopes that one day I could make a living writing only Open Source Software and make this world a better place. Now, being chosen for this position would allow me to contribute and shape the future of Open Source itself!

Why am I a good fit?

- I’ve been using Cloud IDEs since 2012 (Cloud 9, now owned by Amazon)
- I love GitHub so much that I’ve signed up for:
  - Developer Program
  - Sponsors Program
  - Every single new feature preview!
- I’m a contributor and publisher of multiple Open Source projects:
  - One of them is a Git tool
  - Another one just made it to the Arctic Code Vault
- I’m one of the first adopters of the `README.md` profile repo
- On the waiting list for Codespaces
- I use GitHub on a daily basis!

That said, I’m also a professional Full Stack Web Developer with 8 years of experience, a huge passion for the Web, and a regular open-source contributor to a variety of projects/tools.

I have extended experience with web technologies: my career started with PHP and nowadays mostly consists of JavaScript (TypeScript), HTML, and CSS as my 3 main technologies. I also have 2 years of recent remote work experience.

P.S. Fun fact: I was in Manchester exactly 1 year ago today; a wonderful city!

Sincerely,
Rodrigo Graça
